OS X Installation
=================

OS X is not offically supported by the TPP team.  However, thanks to
contributions from TPP users, we do have instructions for building the
TPP and getting started on Apple systems. 


Changes
=======

* Notes on Building TPP on OSX Mavericks (10.9)

* Updated 2013/11/01 following various patching to compile with boost_1.54.0
  and clang v5.0. This is un-tested on any previous version of OSX.


Steps
=====

1. Download and install homebrew from:

	http://brew.sh/
	
2. Install necessary libraries using homebrew
	
	$ brew install gnuplot
	$ brew install libpng
	$ brew install gd
	
3. Create a Makefile.config.incl to configure the build, e.g.

	$ cd trans_proteomic_pipeline/src
	$ vi Makefile.config.incl
	
	TPP_ROOT=/home/user1/tpp/
	TPP_WEB=/tpp/

4. Build and install:

	$ make && make install
	
This *should* finish without problems, leaving TPP ready to use from the
command line. To use the web interface you'll need to install Apache using
homebrew, and configure per the Linux instructions.
