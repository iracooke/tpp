INSTALLATION
------------

1. You will need to first download the latest ExtJs from Sencha to a scratch
area.  After installation it can be removed as only the needed files are
copied from the distribution.

2. If you don't already have a web server installed, please first download
and install Apache.

3. Run: "make install DEST_DIR=<apachedie> EXTJS_DIR=<extsjs dir>" where
<apachedir> is the location you want to install twa in and <extjs dir> is
the location of ExtJs.

4. Lastly you need to configure Apache to both recongize the installation and
also to use mod_rewrite to pass thru the Amazon Web Services REST API calls.
The directives should look something like:

   # TPP Web Launcer for Amazon (TWA) settings
   # The following rewrite rule is necessary to proxy aws EC2 requests
   # to Amazon otherwise browsers run into cross site scripting errors.
   # NOTE: this also has to be BEFORE the directory directive
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteRule /twa/aws/(.*)$ https://ec2.$1.amazonaws.com [P]
   SSLProxyEngine on

   <Directory /var/www/proteomics/twa>
    Options Includes Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
   </Directory>
