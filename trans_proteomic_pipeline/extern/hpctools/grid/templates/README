				     README

This directory contains template files for the various different search
programs supported by TPP.  To use these templates simply copy the
appropriate file for the search engine you would like to use into the
directory where you will be performing the search. 

Template files in this directory should all have filenames beginning with
the name of the search program and ended with the extension ".params".  For
example the generic template file for X!Tandem is tandem.params.  Templates
for common types of projects, such as N15 modified experiments should be
identified with an additional "-" type included in the name, such as
"tandem-N15.params".

Lastly, all templates should also contain the orignal name of the template
along with a short description describing their purpose.
