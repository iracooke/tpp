#
# NAME
#
# Generic Template for mascot parameter files
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
# This is a parameters file for the qmascot command used to run mascot MS/MS
# peptide spectra searches on a cluster.  The format of the file is almost
# identical to the format mascot uses to specify parameters in its "mgf"
# format.  Each parameter is specified on a single line, using a simple
# "name" = "value" format.  Lines beginning with a '#' are precieved as
# comments and are ignored.
#
# For convenience all of the allowable mascot parameters have already been 
# provided in this file along with a short description for each. To use
# a parameter simply uncomment the line the parameter is on and provide a
# value.  Please see the Mascot documentation for more information about the
# allowable values and function of each parameter.
#


# HEADER PARAMETERS -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following parameters, if uncommented will be included in the top
# of every mgf file.
#

# Database to use as defined in the mascot.dat file
# DB=  

# Database entries to be searched.  Takes a list of double quoted, comma
# separated values
# ACCESSION=

# Peptide charge.  Value can be from 8- to 8+ and combinations.
# CHARGE=

# Enzyme.  Values are defined in the mascot enzymes file, e.g. Trypsin.
# CLE=

# Search title that applies to the whole search
# COM=

# Precursor removal.  Pair of comma separated integers.
# CUTOUT=

# Perform decoy search, 0 (false - default) 1 (true)
# DECOY=0

# Error tolerant. 0 (false - default) 1 (true)
# ERRORTOLERANT=0

# MS/MS data file format.  Accepts a whole host of different options, but
# for all intensive purposes this option should not be used.
# FORMAT=

# NA translation. Comma separated list of frames
# FRAMES=

# MS/MS ion series, e.g. ESI-QUAD-TOF.  See mascot documentation for a full 
# list of options.
# INSTRUMENT=

# Fixed modifications as defined in unimod.xml
# MODS=

# Misassigned C13.  Values from 0 to 2.
#PEP_ISOTOPE_ERROR=

# Partials, integer between 0 and 9. Defaults to 1.
# PFA=1

# Precursor m/z, optionally followed by intensity.  Should be > 100.
# PRECURSOR=

# Quantitation method as defined in quantitation.xml
# QUANTITATION=

# Report maximum # hits.   AUTO or integer
# REPORT=

# Type of report.  Value of: protein, peptide, archive, concise, select, or
# unassigned.
# REPTYPE=peptide

# Type of search.  One of PMF, SQ, or MIS
# SEARCH=

# Protein mass (kDa).
# SEG=

# Taxonomy as defined in the mascot taxonomy file.
# TAXONOMY=

# Peptide mass tolerance.
# TOL=

# Units of TOL.  %, ppm, mmu or Da
# TOLU=

# Uncommitted parameters
# USER00=

# USER12=

# User's email
# USEREMAIL=

# User's name
# USERNAME=


# SPECTRUM PARAMETERS ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The remaining parameters found between the BEGIN IONS/END IONS will be
# included at the top of each spectrum iin the mgf file.
# 

BEGIN IONS

# Amino acid composition.
# COMP=

# Error tolerant sequence tag
# ETAG

# MS/MS ion series, e.g. ESI-QUAD-TOF.  See mascot documentation for a full 
# list of options.
# INSTRUMENT=

# Variable modifications.  Format/values defined in the unimod.xml file.
# IT_MODS=

# Peptide mass, optionally followed by intensity. This parameter is here for
# reference only as it should already be provided in the mgf during the
# conversion process.
# PEPMASS=

# Retention time or range (in seconds). 
# RTINSECONDS=

# Scan number of range.
# SCANS=

# Amino acid sequence.  Can have multiple SEQs.
# SEQ=
