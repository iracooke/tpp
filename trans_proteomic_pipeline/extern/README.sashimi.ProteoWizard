Version control ProteoWizard and sashimi

The ProteoWizard tarball represents a snapshot of a subset of the
ProteoWizard (pwiz) project.  We take a subset because the
pwiz tree is currently ill-organized for getting just the
source code, and we'd be grabbing a bunch of binaries we don't want,
which slows the build process (especially in the cloud, where it's
common to deal with a build machine which has just spun up and doesn't
have an svn cache).

Also, using the "svn exernal" mechanism is just too slow and
unreliable, at least for the current projects' hosts.




This tarball represents revision 1132 of

 https://proteowizard.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/proteowizard/trunk/pwiz/pwiz

and

 https://proteowizard.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/proteowizard/trunk/pwiz/libraries/boost_aux




An important note regarding updating this local copy of pwiz:

Make sure the pwiz makefile fragment in

 trans_proteomic_pipeline/src/Makefile.pwiz.incl

still makes sense (as in, did the pwiz source tree shift around?).
We're still not using the official bjam-based build system, it's just
too brittle for now.
