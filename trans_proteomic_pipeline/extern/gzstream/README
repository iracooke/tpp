===========================================================================

    See index.html for documentation and installation instructions.

NOTE: this copy of the gzstream code has been altered by bpratt of Insilicos LLC: a couple of tweaks for VC8 and to support different compression levels, including none at all (write a regular file instead of a gzip file).
