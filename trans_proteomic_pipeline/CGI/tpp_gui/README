Installing PETUNIA: the TPP GUI

The Cygwin installer will take care of step 1, and comes with
the 'guest' account enabled. To create other accounts, please
see step 2B.


1. Set up GUI files and directories:

   Copy/create the following files and directories to C:\Inetpub\tpp-bin\
	tpp_gui.pl
	tpp_gui.css

	images/isb_logo.gif
	images/logo_anim.gif
	images/spc_logo.png
	images/nhlbi.jpg

   Also, create the following directories:
	users/
	users/guest/  [read/writeable by all]


2. Set up the guest account:

   A. Under the tpp-bin/users/guest/ directory, run:
	cygwin> crypt isbTPPspc guest > .password

   B. In order to add a different username, do the following:
	a. Create a tpp-bin/users/NEWUSER/   directory
	b. cd to it (under Cygwin):   cd users/NEWUSER/
	c. run:  crypt isbTPPspc NEWPASSWORD > .password

   nB. "isbTPPspc" is the crypt key; this can be changed, of course


3. Set up a data directory:

   Create a world read/write-able directory at:
	C:\Intetpub\wwwroot\ISB\data\

   Place all data under this, preferrably in separate directories
   (with full permissions, as usual...)

   This location is also configurable, but most SPC Tools expect data to
   be under the wwwroot/  directory.


4. Access it!   http://localhost/tpp-bin/tpp_gui.pl

   Log in as guest/guest, or whatever account you created in step 2.



5. Files to keep track of:
	/tmp/tpp_web.log       has most debug and request info
	/tmp/cmd_<SESSION_ID>  has command output

   The session id can be found by looking under tpp-bin/users/USER/
   There should be a session_<SESSION_ID> file. These don't go away
   yet; need to fix that.


6. Known issues (getting worked on):
	- Some advanced options missing
	- No fancy graphics, yet.
