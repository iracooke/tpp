Windows Build Instructions
==========================

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

These instructions are only for developers who wish to build and/or modify TPP
on the Window's platform.  For users who just wish to use the TPP, you *do not*
have to build it yourself: you should use the provided Windows native installer
which will install the TPP and other required software and configure everything
automatically.


Introduction
------------

The TPP currently supports only one native Windows build platform, MingGW.
MinGW was chosen because it provides a completely free UNIX-like build 
environment.  Historically, we used to use the Cygwin system for the same 
purpose, but its installation process was deemed too complex.  You will also
find Visual Studio C++ project files within the source.  These are provided with
out any support and use of Visual Studio for building TPP has been deprecated.


Prerequisites
-------------

  * MingW - The latest version can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
    Should be installed with the following additional packages:

       mingw-developer-tool
       mingw32-base
       mingw32-gcc-g++
       msys-base
       mingw32-libz
       "wget"
       "unzip"

    The getting started guide at http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started 
    provides excellent notes on how to properly set it up.  Its also very 
    important that your installation folder does not have spaces in it.

    When installing MingW its also important to install MSYS.

  * Perl, version 5.8 or newer.  We strongly recommend using ActiveState
    perl, http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/.

  * NSIS installer, http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download.  Follow standard 
    install options.

  * SVN, TortoiseSVN client found at http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads


Launch MSYS
-----------


Checkout Source
---------------

Choose a local directory to work in and a repository branch (probably
the current stable release branch, or the unstable trunk) and check
out the source.  

  svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sashimi/code/trunk/trans_proteomic_pipeline tpp-trunk


Building
--------

Launch a new MSYS window, change to the directory trans_proteomic_pipeline/src
then type "make".


Installer
---------

To build a Windows installer, from the trans_proteomic_pipeline/src directory
type "make install". This will run the NSIS installer to build a Windows
.exe installer file, normally named "TPP_Setup.exe" in the build area.
